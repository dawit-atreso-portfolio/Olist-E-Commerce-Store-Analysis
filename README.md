## Task
Olist Store is the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over
Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. The Brazilian eCommerce public dataset of orders (from
2016 to 2018) made at Olist Store has been provided to your company for analysis.

Analyse the provided dataset using data analytics skills, prepare a PowerBI
dashboard with visualisations that answer key questions, as well as prepare and present a final report.

## The report addresses the following key questions:
Feedback Sentiment Analysis: Evaluate the polarity of the tweets as customer feedback positive, negative or
neutral.
Clustering: Some customers did not write a review. But for those that did, why are they happy or mad?
Sales Prediction: With purchase date information you will be able to predict future sales.
Delivery Performance: to work through delivery performance and find ways to optimise
delivery times.

## Tools Used
Excel: Data manulplation and cleaning.
Power BI Desktop: Using Advanced DAX Functions to find measurments and columns for creating dynamic and interactive visualizations to present the findings effectively.
